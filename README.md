# math-code
Small programs to simply be familiar with math functions that I study in my spare time. A lot of this is very basic. I'm re-learning a lot of math and use various resources such as OpenStax, Khan Academy, YouTube, etc. in my spare time. I often find it easy to create programs to solve math problems instead of using my calculator. I also find that a lot of math concepts translate well to programming concepts. I figured this repo would be good to maintain in addition to Project-Euler, and I just like to write out simple things in Python or C as an alternate method of note taking.
